# What is internet?

Internet, a system architecture that has revolutionized communications and methods of commerce by allowing various computer networks around the world to interconnect. Sometimes referred to as a “network of networks,” the Internet emerged in the United States in the 1970s but did not become visible to the general public until the early 1990s. By 2020, approximately 4.5 billion people, or more than half of the world’s population, were estimated to have access to the Internet.

## Domain and IP address?
- Domain
  - Domain is the location of website.
    - i.e. domain name is 'google.com' that points to IP address "216.58.216.164".
    - Domain name is used so that it is easier to memorize.

- IP Address
  - An IP address is a number identifying of a computer or another device on the Internet. It is similar to a mailing address, which identifies where postal mail comes from and where it should be delivered. IP addresses uniquely identify the source and destination of data transmitted with the Internet Protocol.

- Protocol
  - A methods used to exchange data over a computer network.
    - How data is formatted when sent.
    - What to do with data when sent.
    - How data is compressed.
    - How to check for errors in the data.
  - HTTP?
    - Short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP is a set of standards that allow users of the World Wide Web to exchange information found on web pages. When accessing any web page entering http:// in front of the address tells the browser to communicate over HTTP. For example, the URL for Computer Hope is https://www.computerhope.com. Today's browsers no longer require HTTP in front of the URL since it is the default method of communication. However, it is kept in browsers because of the need to separate protocols such as FTP.
